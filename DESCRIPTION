Description: This function fits the joint model proposed by Henderson et al.
    (2000), but extended to the case of multiple continuous longitudinal measures.
    The time-to-event data is modelled using a Cox proportional hazards regression
    model with time-varying covariates. The multiple longitudinal outcomes are
    modelled using a multivariate version of the Laird and Ware linear mixed model.
    The association is captured by a multivariate latent Gaussian process. The model
    is estimated using a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm.
