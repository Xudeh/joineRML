## Other notes

I have resubmitted this package so soon because the CRAN Status for OSX (release) is showing FAIL, which I think is a time out because the check log ends "checking PDF version of manual ...". Consequently, there is no binary build for OS X El Capitan. I have posted on R-pkg-devel and emailed Simon Urbanek privately, but have had no response. I am hoping this version will satisfy the CRAN checks. I apologise for resubmitting so soon after the previous submission.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.0
* ubuntu (via travis-ci)
* windows (via appveyor)
* win-builder (release, devel)
* tested on several R-hub platforms
